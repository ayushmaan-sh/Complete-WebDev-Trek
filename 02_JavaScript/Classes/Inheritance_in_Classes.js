// Inheritance in JavaScript classes allows one class to inherit properties and methods from another class. This mechanism enables code reuse, making it easier to create new classes that are based on existing ones, without having to duplicate code.

class Circle {
   constructor(radius, color) {
       this.radius = radius;  
       this.color = color;
   }

   area() {
      const area = this.radius * this.radius * Math.PI;
       return area;
   }
   
   paint() {
			console.log(`Painting with color ${this.color}`);
   }
