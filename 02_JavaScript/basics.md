# Javascript - The Basics

## Web Development
Web development involves writing a lot of HTML, CSS, and JS code. 
Historically (and even today to some extent), browsers could only understand HTML, CSS, and JS.
Any website that you see is a bunch of HTML, CSS, and JS files along with some assets (images, videos, etc).

## Facts/Callouts
- **React** and **NextJS** are frameworks. They compile down to HTML, CSS, and JS in the end. That is what your browser understands.
- When you run your C++ code on LeetCode, it does not run on your browser/machine. It runs somewhere else. Your browser can’t (almost) compile and run C++ code.
- If someone asks — "What languages can your browser interpret?" The answer is **HTML, CSS, JS, and WebAssembly**. It can, technically, run C++/Rust code that is compiled down to Wasm.
